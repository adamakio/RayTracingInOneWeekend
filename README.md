# RayTracingInOneWeekend
This repository hosts my implementation of the foundational ray tracing engine as described in Peter Shirley's "Ray Tracing in One Weekend." The code is developed in C++ and is designed to illustrate basic ray tracing concepts such as rendering spheres, handling diffuse and specular reflections, and simple shadows. This project is perfect for anyone new to computer graphics or looking to understand the mechanics of ray tracing through hands-on coding.
